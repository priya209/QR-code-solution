## Overview
This project is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

In this challenge, I built a responsive QR code component that adapts to both mobile and desktop screen sizes. The component displays a QR code with a brief description, styled to match the design provided in the challenge.
